"""Reconcile N pipeline runs of the SAME task into one final JSON + HTML.

The audit/augment stages are LLM calls and vary run to run: 3 vs 5 claims, V4 vs
V4a/V4b, a trap value of 3 one run and 1 the next, a split that appears or not.
Scoring a single run inherits whichever way that run fell. This module takes
several runs and produces one reconciled golden by SELECT AND MERGE — it chooses
among the real alternatives the runs produced and never authors new content.

Pipeline (agreed design):
  1. CLUSTER (master LLM): group each run's claims/verifiers into conceptual
     ROLES. A keyword key fragments ~6 real roles into ~15 (labels vary run to
     run), so clustering is semantic, done once by the LLM. The LLM only assigns
     existing items to groups; it writes no verifier text.
  2. VOTE within each cluster (deterministic): the modal value / text wins, and
     the tally is recorded. Majority = >= ceil(N/2) agreeing.
  3. ADJUDICATE VALUES (master LLM, can OVERRIDE majority): majority counts, it
     does not judge correctness — if the model repeats a mistake in most runs,
     majority entrenches it (observed: 2 runs say wait=38, 1 says 42; 38 is
     wrong). So for each value the LLM is shown the derivation context and the
     vote, and may override the majority. Every override is logged with its
     reason, in BOTH the JSON (`adjudication.overrides`) and the HTML.
  4. MERGE + EMIT: assemble the winning items into one package, re-id verifiers
     V1..Vn, and render an HTML with the decision + override log visible.

The master LLM does two jobs (cluster, adjudicate) — both SELECT/JUDGE over real
run content, never author. Each is one non-deterministic call; to make the
adjudicator itself reproducible, run it K times and majority-vote its outputs
(a later option, not done here). Both LLM entry points accept an injected
callable, so the module is fully testable without a live model.

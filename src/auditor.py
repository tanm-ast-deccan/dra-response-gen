# src/auditor.py
"""
Two-call task auditor for the DRA prompt-QC pipeline.

Flow per task:
  0. Parse + gate the existing verifiers (verifier_parser). Uncertain -> flag.
  1. CALL 1 (Opus): audit + emit structured arithmetic claims + preliminary findings.
  2. CODE: recompute the claims (arithmetic_verifier). Authoritative for numbers.
  3. Short-circuit: if call 1 is clean (SOUND, no claims errored, no findings),
     skip call 2 and emit a SOUND result.
  4. CALL 2 (Opus): finalize verdict + corrections, grounded in the code results.
  5. Assemble AuditResult (JSON-serializable) + prose.

Column access is by HEADER NAME via a resolver (never by index).

The Opus judge has no fallback (hard-stop) — see prompt_evaluator.MODEL_FALLBACK_CHAIN.

# Output token ceilings. These are safety rails against truncation, NOT budgets —

# generated, so a high ceiling you don't hit is free. They are set generously so
# a legitimate audit never truncates, but low enough that a response which
# actually hits the ceiling trips `likely_truncated` and signals an abnormally
# long (rambling / over-claiming) response worth investigating rather than
# silently absorbing. Call 1 (analysis + all claims + findings) is the large one;
# Call 2 (corrections) is smaller.
#: Opus 4.8 allows up to 128,000 output tokens on the Messages API, and
#: _call_llm already streams (required above roughly 16k to avoid a request
#: timeout). Adaptive thinking shares this budget with the visible text, so the
#: figure must cover BOTH — which is why these are far above the size of the JSON

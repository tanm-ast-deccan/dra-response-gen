Fourth call: are the verifiers themselves well formed, and which step does each
prose verifier test?

WHY A CALL AND NOT CODE
    Atomicity, mutual exclusivity, self-containment and falsifiability are
    semantic. A regex attempt at them measured 59% precision on a hand-labelled
    sample of 25 — too low to act on. Matching a prose verifier to its judgment
    step is the same kind of judgment: "reject adding permanent front end
    staffing" and "Option A add front-end staff or Option B pool" mean the same
    thing and share almost no vocabulary (name agreement 0.18).

WHY THE OUTPUT IS FROZEN
    The derived verifier DAG must be repeatable — same trajectory in, same graph
    out. So this call runs ONCE, its resolved mappings are frozen into the
    artifact, and derive_verifier_dag reads the frozen mapping. Determinism is
    preserved by freezing the non-deterministic step, not by avoiding it.

WHAT IT MAY AND MAY NOT CHANGE
    May: rewrite a verifier IN PLACE, keeping its id.
    May: resolve which step a verifier tests.
    May: split a verifier. Children take SUFFIXED ids — V5 becomes V5a and V5b —
    so the parent's lineage stays readable and no existing id is renumbered. Since
    the dependency graph is DERIVED from the trajectory rather than asserted, a
    split needs no edge surgery: the children are mapped to steps and the graph,
    weights, crux set and Shapley weights all recompute from them.

You are auditing whether each verifier in a benchmark is well FORMED. You are not \
grading a response, not re-deriving the answer, and not judging whether the \
verifier's target value is correct — the target is already frozen and verified.

Two failure directions, and the second is worse. Passing a badly formed verifier \
means a scoring criterion nobody can apply consistently. But flagging a sound one \
costs a human's attention and, if the rewrite lands, changes what the benchmark \
measures. So when a verifier is defensible under a reasonable reading, PASS it.

Quote the span you are objecting to. A verdict of FAIL with no quoted text is not \
reviewable and will be treated as noise.

You may rewrite a verifier in place, and you may split one that tests two things. \
A split keeps the parent's number with a letter suffix, so V5 becomes V5a and V5b \
and no other verifier is renumbered. Say which child carries the parent's frozen \
target; a child that carries none is not eligible for the crux set, which is the \
correct outcome for a structural check.\
"""

PROPERTY_SPEC = """\
=== ATOMIC ===
One verifier, one assertion. ONE ASSERTION = ONE PREDICATE ON ONE REFERENT, WHERE
THE REFERENT MAY BE A NAMED SET.
  atomic:     "the bridge contains exactly these 7 rows, in order: (1)... (7)..."
              — one predicate ("contains exactly, in order") on an enumerated set
  NOT atomic: "bridge has 7 rows AND row 3 is X AND row 4 is Y" — three assertions
Do NOT flag: a number that is part of the single target's derivation ("= 162,532.41
(4.0% of FY2025 labour)"); a unit or window ("240 tickets in 4 hours"); a number
inside a label ("Phase 2", "2-wheeler", "FY2025"); or a fail-if half plus a target
half of the SAME quantity.

THE SET CASE — DECIDE IT WITH THIS TEST, NOT BY FEEL.
"the referent may be a named set" is ambiguous on its own: "allocation: PC = 2.565,
Filtration = 1.215, IC = 1.620" reads as one predicate over a three-member set AND
as three assertions, and both are defensible. That ambiguity made the same verifier
pass as atomic on one run and split three ways on the next. Resolve it by asking:

    IS A PARTIAL FAILURE WORTH ATTRIBUTING?

  * NO -> atomic. "contains exactly these 7 rows, in order" — a response either
    produced the right bridge or it did not; knowing which row is wrong buys the
    grader nothing, because the bridge is the unit of correctness.
  * YES -> NOT atomic, split it. If any single member carries diagnostic weight of
    its own, bundling makes a response that gets one member wrong and the rest
    right unscoreable in either direction.

A member carries diagnostic weight when it is any of:
  * the TRAP element — the one a shallow solver gets wrong. You are given each
    step's trap value; if a member matches or relates to one, the set MUST split.
  * a DECISION, or an input to one, where members can disagree (two segments
    flagged and one not).
  * separately reported in the deliverable, so a grader could observe one member
    without the others.

Worked example, from a real task: overhead allocated across three segments where
the whole trap is that the obsolete driver wrongly pushes ONE segment below the
threshold. That segment's figure is the discriminating fact. Bundled, a response
that gets it wrong and the other two right cannot be graded correctly. SPLIT.

Counter-example: a bridge table's seven rows, where the task is to reconcile the
bridge. No single row is the trap and none is reported alone. ATOMIC.

=== QUANTIFIABLE ===
The target is drawn from a stated, finite, checkable set. NOT "must be a number":
  numeric   — a number with a band
  decision  — a member of a stated set: {GO, NO-GO}, {ACCEPT, REJECT}
  presence  — {present, absent}: "names the brand-dilution risk", "cites the URL"
The genuinely bad case is the open judgment with no finite answer set — "is the
analysis rigorous?" — which belongs in the 0-4 subjective rubric, not here. The
trap is the seductive middle: "the recommendation is well-justified" feels
checkable but states no set. Decompose it into presence checks or send it to the
rubric; never leave it as a pseudo-binary verifier.

=== SELF-CONTAINED ===
Could a competent grader holding the response, but who has NOT seen the golden,
score this from the verifier's own text? If not it points at the standard instead
of being it.
  "bridge is exactly 7 rows"     -> name the 7 rows
  "the correct discount rate"    -> state the rate
  "all required sections"        -> enumerate them
  "matches the golden"           -> inline the actual target

=== FALSIFIABLE ===
The verifier can be FAILED by a wrong answer. The question is not whether wrong
numbers are listed — it is whether anything a wrong solver could do would slip
past.

For a numeric verifier with a tight band, THE BAND IS THE FAILURE CONDITION and
that is sufficient. PASS it. Do not ask for a clause naming particular wrong
values: "annual savings = ₹2.0-2.4 Cr" already rejects ₹22 Cr, ₹1.5 Cr and every
other wrong figure, so appending "FAIL if ₹22 Cr" adds nothing and merely fits the
one error someone happened to notice. Enumerating wrong values is not rigour.

FAIL only where a wrong solver could SATISFY the verifier anyway:

  (a) Wrong route, right number. The verifier checks a value but not how it was
      obtained, and the value is reachable by a method the task forbids. A bridge
      that reconciles on wrong inputs passes "the bridge reconciles". Fix by
      naming the required source or method, not by listing wrong totals:
        weak:   "Exchange rate used = ₹92.60/USD"
        strong: "Exchange rate = ₹92.60/USD, fetched live for 19 Apr 2026 and
                cited; the file's rate must not be used as the source."
      The distinction is SOURCE, not arithmetic — both could print 92.60.

  (b) A large failing space with no boundary. Decisions, presence and string
      verifiers have no band, so "= ACCEPT" leaves open what a hedged answer,
      an absent recommendation or a conditional counts as:
        weak:   "Final decision = ACCEPT dual sourcing"
        strong: "Final decision = ACCEPT dual sourcing, stated unconditionally.
                A hedged or conditional recommendation, or no explicit decision
                line, fails."

  (c) The verifier asserts a relationship rather than a realised value, so it
      holds regardless of inputs: "the bridge reconciles", "totals are
      internally consistent".

You are shown each step's TRAP VALUE where one exists. Use it ONLY to judge
whether the trap could pass the verifier as written — not as a value to quote.
Whether the trap falls inside the frozen band is checked in code and reported to
you separately; do not duplicate that check.

When you fail one, the rewrite adds a source or method constraint, or a boundary
for a non-numeric answer. It does not add a list of wrong numbers.

=== HOW TO WRITE A VERIFIER: THE TARGET CLAUSE ===
Everything you write is free prose EXCEPT the clause that states what a correct
response must show. That clause has a fixed shape so it can be read by code as
well as by a grader. Measured on a real 29-verifier task, only 17 could be read
mechanically; the 12 failures were almost all punctuation drift, not missing
information.

WRITE THE TARGET CLAUSE LAST, IN ONE OF THESE FOUR FORMS:

  numeric    ... = <number> <unit> (+/- <band>)
             The band comes IMMEDIATELY after the value. Put any derivation
             BEFORE the "=", never between the value and the band.
               yes: Precision Components corrected operating margin (2.535/38)
                    = 6.67% (+/- 0.05pp)
               no:  ... = 6.67% (2.535/38) (+/- 0.05pp)     <- band unreachable
               no:  ... corrected to $1.215 mln (+/- 0.001) <- use "=", not "to"

  decision   ... = <TOKEN>
             One token from a set the verifier states. The token must follow the
             "=", because a decision word inside prose is not a target: a FORMAT
             verifier reading "each with its own explicit FLAG / DO NOT FLAG
             conclusion" was mis-read as a decision verifier.
               yes: Decision for Precision Components = FLAG
               no:  States an explicit decision to FLAG Precision Components

  string     ... = "<exact string>"
               yes: Workbook filename = "ABC_Q2FY26_MarginReview.xlsx"

  presence   no "=" clause at all. Presence checks assert that something is
             stated, cited or included, and have no value to compare.
               yes: Cites the Finance Policy Memo dated 23 March 2026
               yes: Workbook contains three dynamic, formula-driven tabs

  Then, if the verifier names a failing case, add it as its own final clause:
               FAIL IF <condition>
             e.g. "... = 8.25% (+/- 0.05pp). FAIL IF reported as 7.13%, which is
             what the obsolete employee-count basis produces."

ONE VALUE PER VERIFIER. A clause asserting several values at once ("confirms the
allocations: PC $2.565, Filtration $1.215, IC $1.620") has no single target and
cannot be read mechanically — and by the atomicity test above it should have been
split anyway. If it genuinely must stay whole, write it as a presence check.

This constrains only the tail. The description before it is yours: say whatever
the verifier needs to say, including for a coverage gap you are filling.

=== TOLERANCED ===
A numeric verifier states its band IN ITS OWN TEXT, proportioned to the quantity
and no wider than the task's determinism requires. The frozen target carries a
`tol` machine-side, but a grader reading only the verifier must be able to see
what counts as close enough.

Three things are routinely confused:
  a BAND bounds distance from a stated target: "= 1,628,354.48 +/- 500",
    "within 0.5%", "in the range 8580 to 8780", "₹127-132"
  a THRESHOLD says which side of a line to be on: ">= 95%", "< 18% hurdle". A
    threshold is NOT a band.
  an UNDECLARED BAND is the defect: "~₹5.09", "about 17.2 hours",
    "approximately 50.8%". The word "about" is not a band. State the number and
    its band.
You are shown each verifier's frozen tol. FAIL when the text carries no band and
tol is non-zero (the band exists but only the machine can see it), when the text
says "~" or "about" instead of a band, or when the text's range and the frozen
tol disagree materially. PASS exact integer counts, given input constants,
decisions and strings — say so rather than flagging them.

=== CONTENT_NOT_ORDINAL ===
Pin by semantic key ("the pre-opening-costs row"), not by position ("row 3").
Position is legitimate ONLY when the prompt fixes the layout — say so if it does.

=== MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY (set-level) ===
No two verifiers assert the same fact. Duplicates double-weight whatever they
duplicate and can ship a self-contradicting golden — two verifiers once asserted
the same CAGR at 22.78% and 17.11%, invisible until they disagreed. Duplicates are
defects EVEN WHEN THEY AGREE, because they drift apart later.

Rules:
- EVERY verifier id above must appear in "verifiers", in order. None may be omitted.
- "tests_step" is the id of the derivation step this verifier checks, or null when
  it tests something outside the derivation — a format requirement, or what the
  report must STATE rather than compute. Null is a legitimate answer; do not
  stretch for a match. This field is FROZEN and a dependency graph is derived from
  it, so a wrong link silently reweights the whole scoring scheme.
- "rewrite" keeps the SAME id and must preserve the verifier's intent and its
  frozen target value. Use it for wording defects: naming a fail-if condition,
  inlining a target the verifier only pointed at, replacing a positional
  reference with a semantic one.
- "split_into" replaces a non-atomic verifier with two or more children. Give a
  short "suffix" per child (a, b, c) and set "inherits_target" true on exactly the
  ONE child the parent's frozen value belongs to. An empty list means no split.
- IF ANOTHER CHILD ALSO ASSERTS A NUMBER, give it its own "target". A child that
  asserts a value with no target cannot be scored: there is nothing to compare
  against. Observed: "Lead time applied correctly (40 days vs 10 days)" split into
  40-days and 10-days children, and the second was left targetless. Only a purely
  structural child ("the row is present") may have no target.
- If a verifier is an irreducibly open judgment, set kind to
  "not_a_binary_verifier", route_to_rubric true, and name the dimension.
- Output ONLY the <analysis> block then the JSON. No prose after the JSON.

# src/augment_task.py
"""
Task augmenter. Runs on top of the existing two-call auditor.

ORDERING INVARIANT (why this file is shaped the way it is):
  Every automatic change, suggested change, and judgment-required generation is
  produced BEFORE the finalization call (auditor Call 2). The frozen graph
  (DAG -> weights -> crux -> Shapley) authors no text, so it is computed LAST —
  and "last" means after the SME seals the package (see apply_decisions), not
  here. This module runs a PREVIEW freeze so a package is inspectable before SME
  review; apply_decisions re-runs the identical freeze on the sealed artifacts.

Per task:
  0. audit_task(...)         -> verified arithmetic + corrected artifacts +
                                the FINALIZED verifier set. As of the 1b reorder
                                the auditor runs the property audit (splits/
                                rewrites) and freezes targets from verifier text,
                                so the verifier set arrives atomic and final and
                                augment never authors or splits verifiers.
  1. apply corrections       -> corrected package fields (no SME gate; JUDGMENT
                                edits applied now but tagged for later SME review)
  2. AUGMENT Opus call       -> golden deliverable + Sanity-Check anchors, authored
                                OVER the auditor's final verifier set. Augment may
                                only EXTEND the set (add verifiers for uncovered
                                gold values); it never re-splits or re-authors.
                                The augmenter's asserted DAG edges are NOT used.
  3. derive_frozen_graph()   -> verifier set -> step graph -> mapping -> coverage
                                -> DAG -> base weights -> crux -> Shapley.
                                PREVIEW ONLY here; the authoritative freeze runs
                                in apply_decisions after SME resolution.
  4. assemble AugmentResult (JSON-serializable) for CSV + HTML emit

Because the verifier set is finalized in the auditor (before augment), the old
Call-2 -> augment -> property-audit cycle is gone: augment now consumes a final
set instead of producing one.

The three crux metrics are computed later per-response by the scorer; the
freeze fixes the crux set + Shapley weights so scoring is pure matching.

derive_frozen_graph is the single re-derivation routine shared by this module
(preview) and apply_decisions (authoritative seal), so the two can never
diverge: identical code, only the inputs (pre- vs post-SME artifacts) differ.

    after any edit to the verifier set, the targets, or the claim verdicts. It is
    called twice with the same code: once here as a preview, once in
    apply_decisions as the authoritative seal; only the inputs differ.

    `compute_shapley` gates the crux-only Shapley computation. It is expensive
    (Monte-Carlo over verifier coalitions) AND its value is meaningful only on the
    FINAL sealed set — computing it at preview time produces a number that the SME
    edits then invalidate, and whose run-to-run wobble is pure noise because the
    pre-seal verifier set itself varies. So Shapley is OFF at preview and ON only
    at the seal (apply_decisions passes compute_shapley=True). Preview still emits
    the crux set and base weights; only the Shapley layer waits for the seal.

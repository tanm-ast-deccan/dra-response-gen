"""Apply an SME decisions file to an augment package and seal it.

    python apply_decisions.py --augment output/augmented/tsk_X_augment.json \
        --decisions decisions_tsk_X_2026-08-03.json --out output/final

This is the last step of audit + augmentation. Until it runs, a package carries
unresolved judgment questions, and a package with unresolved judgment questions is
not scoreable — not because a rule says so, but because the model resolves an open
question differently on different runs. On one task the FX ambiguity resolved as
the live rate (savings 2.20 Cr) and on the next as the file rate (0.918 Cr): same
task, same code, two goldens with different answers and different frozen targets.
An answered question, written into the artifact, is what stops that.

WHAT EACH DECISION DOES
  accept          the proposal stands as-is
  reject + reason a mechanical change is REVERTED; a rewrite or split is undone;
                  a proposed verifier is not added
  other  + reason the SME's text replaces the proposal
  question        the SME's answer is applied and recorded; the question closes

SME edits reach every artifact a resolution can change: the corrected prompt,
sanity check and solution logic, the verifier block, AND the auditor's deliverable
and trajectory (a resolution that changes a value must move the deliverable with
it, or the sealed golden contradicts its own solution logic).

THE SEAL RE-DERIVES THE FROZEN GRAPH. An SME edit can change the verifier id space
(a reverted split drops V5a/V5b and restores V5; an accepted gap adds a verifier)
or a frozen target, so the DAG, base weights, crux set and Shapley weights computed
at augment time are stale by the time the package is sealed. Sealing therefore
re-runs augment_task.derive_frozen_graph on the edited artifacts — the SAME routine
the augmenter used for its preview, so the two cannot diverge — and only then marks
the package sealed. A re-derive that cannot run means the sealed set is inconsistent
and the package is marked not-scoreable rather than shipping a stale graph.

REFUSALS
  * a run_hash mismatch means the decisions were made against a different run of
    this task, so applying them would edit text the reviewer never saw
  * an incomplete file (any item undecided, or a reject/other with no reason, or a
    question with no answer) is refused; a partly-sealed package is worse than an
    unsealed one because nothing downstream can tell which it is

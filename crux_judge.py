crux_judge.py — LLM-as-judge crux selection, GOLDEN-ANCHORED.

The crux = verifiers whose value the golden REPORTS AS AN ANSWER: the final
decision plus the key computed results the deliverable/solution-logic actually
states as conclusions. NOT raw inputs, NOT internal intermediates the memo never
surfaces, NOT filename/format checks, NOT restatements with no distinct value.

The judge is given, per task:
  - golden solution logic + golden deliverable text  (the reported answers)
  - the verifiers with their expected values + kinds
  - a STRUCTURAL HINT from the DAG: the final-deliverable node(s) (deepest) and
    their immediate parents — to orient attention on the answer region.
It returns the verifier IDs holding the reported answers.

Reads augment JSONs (which carry corrected_solution_logic, gold_deliverable_text,
expected_values, dag, depths). Works on a directory of {task}_augment.json.

Emits:
  crux_labels.json        {task_id: [crux ids]}
  crux_judge_detail.json  {task_id: {reported_answers:[...], reasoning:...}}

Usage:
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
  python crux_judge.py --aug-dir ./output_2/augmented --out crux_labels.json

SYSTEM = """You identify the CRUX verifiers of a hard analytical task.

CRUX = the verifiers whose value the GOLDEN reports as an ANSWER: the final \
decision/recommendation, plus the key computed results the deliverable actually \
STATES as conclusions (e.g. the per-option totals it compares, the headline figure, \
the final decision). 

NOT crux:
- Raw inputs / given assumptions. This is the most common error to avoid: any figure \
that is READ from an input file rather than COMPUTED is not crux, even if the memo \
restates it. This includes given rates (repo rate, carrying %, FX premium), given \
capex figures, given demand/volume, given per-unit prices, and given time periods. \
If the value's source_of_verification is "source_file" it is almost always a given \
input, NOT a reported answer — exclude it.
- Internal intermediate steps the memo does not surface as a reported result.
- Filename / file-format / section-present / formatting checks.
- Pure restatements that carry no distinct computed value.
- Tautologies (e.g. "probabilities sum to 1").

A reported ANSWER is something the analysis COMPUTES and the memo states as a \
conclusion (a total, a delta, a ratio, the final decision) — not a number lifted \
directly from an input file. When unsure, prefer values whose \
source_of_verification is "arithmetic" or "llm_judgment" (computed/judged) over \
"source_file" (given).

Method: read the golden's stated conclusions. For each verifier, ask "is this \
verifier's value one of the answers the golden REPORTS?" Use the DAG hint (the final \
deliverable node and its immediate parents) to orient toward the answer region, but \
the GOLDEN's reported conclusions are the authority, not the DAG shape. Typically \
3-6 crux per task.
